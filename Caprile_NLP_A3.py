PROBLEM 1.

Write a function has_most_consonants() that takes a string as input and returns
the words that have the largest number of consonants in them. For this exercise,
consonants are just letters like t and k (in fact, all letters except a, e, i, o
and u). You may use split() to get the tokens and you do not need to worry about
splitting off punctuations. The

>>> has_most_consonants('The door is closed. And many dogs barked.')
['closed.', 'barked.']
>>> has_most_consonants('')
[]


PROBLEM 2.

Write a function called is_determiner() that takes a word as input and decides
if it is a determiner.

>>> is_determiner('the')
True
>>> is_determiner('thesis')
False

Then create another function remove_determiners() that uses is_determiner() and
that eliminates all determiners in a piece of a text.

>>> remove_determiners('the dog is asleep in a basket.')
'dog is asleep in basket.'

Contrary to what I said in class, do not worry about punctuation. But do worry
about removing things like 'The'.


PROBLEM 3.

Given an embedded list such as

   [['a', 'big', 'red', 'dog'], ['chased', ['a', 'small', 'red', 'cat']]]

where the embedding can be of any depth, but where the contents of the lists are
either other lists or strings. Write a function to replace all instances of an
arbitrary word with a new word.

>>> lst = [['a', 'big', 'red', 'dog'], ['chased', ['a', 'small', 'red', 'cat']]]
>>> replace_word(lst, 'a', 'the')
[['the', 'big', 'red', 'dog'], ['chased', ['the', 'small', 'red', 'cat']]]


PROBLEM 4.

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary of
bigrams and their frequencies. As part of this, split off end-of-sentence
punctuation markers and commas and put all words in lower case. You can reuse
part of your solution to assignment 2 here.

>>> bigrams = get_bigrams('The dog is asleep in a basket? Yes, in a basket!')
>>> sorted(bigrams.items())[:4]
[((',', 'in'), 1), (('?', 'yes'), 1), (('a', 'basket'), 2), (('asleep', 'in'), 1)]

In addition, write a similar function for trigrams.

>>> trigrams = get_trigrams('The dog is asleep in a basket? Yes, in a basket!')
>>> sorted(trigrams.items())[:3]
[((',', 'in', 'a'), 1), (('?', 'yes', ','), 1), (('a', 'basket', '!'), 1)]


PROBLEM 5 (extra credit).

Write a function that takes as input a string and a number (the number being the
n in ngrams) and returns a dictionary of ngrams and their frequencies.

>>> ngrams = get_ngrams('The dog is asleep in a basket? Yes, in a basket!', 2)
>>> sorted(ngrams.items())[:4]
[((',', 'in'), 1), (('?', 'yes'), 1), (('a', 'basket'), 2), (('asleep', 'in'), 1)]
>>> ngrams = get_ngrams('The dog is asleep in a basket? Yes, in a basket!', 3)
>>> sorted(ngrams.items())[:3]
[((',', 'in', 'a'), 1), (('?', 'yes', ','), 1), (('a', 'basket', '!'), 1)]

Makes sure that this works for any integer higher than 1, not just bigrams and
trigrams. This means you need to give a meaningful message for those cases where
ngrams would be longer than the text itself.
